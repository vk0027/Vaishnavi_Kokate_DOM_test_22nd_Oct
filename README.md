HTML Structure
The HTML code defines the structure of the web page and includes various elements such as headings, buttons, tables, and input fields. Here's an overview of the key elements:

Document Type Declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>): This declaration specifies that the document follows the HTML5 standard.

<html>: The root element of the HTML document.

<head>: Contains metadata and links to external resources.

<title>: Specifies the title of the web page.
<meta>: Defines the character set and viewport settings for responsive design.
<link>: Imports the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
<style>: Contains CSS styles for the page.
<body>: The main content of the web page.

<h1>: A heading that displays "IP Address Finder."
<p>: Displays the user's IP address, which will be updated using JavaScript.
<button>: A button with the ID "get-data" that triggers data retrieval.
<table>: A table with the ID "user-info" for displaying location information.
<div>: A container with the ID "map" for displaying Google Maps.
<input>: An input field with the ID "search-postal-office" for searching postal offices.
<div>: A container with the ID "postal-offices" for displaying search results.
CSS Styles
The CSS code defines styles for various elements on the web page. It includes styling for the body, headings, tables, buttons, input fields, and additional elements.

JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code enhances the functionality of the web page. It uses jQuery for making AJAX requests and interacts with external APIs to retrieve and display data. Here's an explanation of the JavaScript functionality:

IP Address Retrieval: The code uses an AJAX request to fetch the user's IP address from https://api.ipify.org/?format=json and displays it on the web page.

Location Data Retrieval: When the "Get Data" button is clicked, an AJAX request is made to https://ipinfo.io/{ipAddress}/geo to retrieve location information based on the user's IP address. The retrieved data is then displayed in a table, and a Google Map is generated with a marker at the user's location.

Google Maps Integration: Google Maps is integrated into the page using the Google Maps JavaScript API. It displays a map centered on the user's location with a marker.

Time Zone Display: The function getLocalTime is defined to get the current time in the user's time zone based on the retrieved location data.

External Dependencies
The code depends on the following external resources:

jQuery Library: The code includes the jQuery library from https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js for making AJAX requests.

Google Maps API: You need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with a valid Google Maps API key to enable the Google Maps functionality.

Instructions for Usage
Ensure that you have a valid Google Maps API key and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your API key in the script tag.

Host the HTML file and associated resources on a web server.

Users can visit the web page, click the "Get Data" button to retrieve their location information, and view their location on the Google Map.

Users can also use the search input field to search for postal offices, but this functionality is not yet implemented in the provided code.
